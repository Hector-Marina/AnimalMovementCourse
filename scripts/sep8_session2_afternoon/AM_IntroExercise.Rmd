*Hej Hej* !

Welcome to the Animal Movement PhD course! We have prepared some exercises to help you:

- verify that you have installed all the packages needed for the course\
- get familiar with the GitHub content\
- run simple descriptive statistics on the course data.

To run this script correctly, we recommend opening it (*AM_IntroExercise.Rmd*) in R-Studio. This will enable you to modify the script's contents in the various command boxes and save the changes and results. We estimate that preparation will take 1â€“2 hours.

Let's get to work! ;-)

## Package installation

We have prepared a script to help you install all the packages required for the course. First, the script will check that you have the correct version of R installed. Then, it will install the required R packages if they are not already installed. Let's now take a look at how it works:\
\
1. It checks if a package is already installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
requireNamespace("ggplot2")==TRUE
```

\
2. It installs the package if it was not already installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

\
3. It checks if the installation was performed correctly:

```{r eval=FALSE}
requireNamespace("ggplot2")==TRUE
```

\
\
Now, you can execute the package installation script:

```{r eval=FALSE}
source(".installpackages.R")
```

```         
Note: If you did not open the document as instructed, you may need to adjust the command path.
The installation script can be found in this directory: ./scripts/sep4_session2_afternoon/.installpackages.R 
```

## Descriptive statistics exercises

The next two exercises will introduce you to the data that we will use throughout the course.

### Exercise 1: Outdoor data

#### Step 1: Import the indoor data file

Read the file `./data/raw/outdoor/gpsdata_april_june2021.csv`.

```{r}
# Write here your code
```

\

#### Step 2: Number of individuals

Now, summarise the number of individuals contained in this file. 

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

\

#### Step 3: Simple plots

Please select an individual and plot their location during the study period.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

\

### Exercise 2: Indoor data

#### Step 1: Read in the indoor data file

Read the file `./data/raw/indoor/FA_EarlyLactationGroup_20201017.txt`.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

\

#### Step 2: Number of data points per individual

Select an individual from the list of individuals in the file `./data/raw/indoor/EarlyLactationGroup_idList.txt` and summarise the number of data points for that individual in the position data file.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

\

#### Step 3: Simple plots

Please read the file `./data/raw/indoor/Cow_Phenotypes.csv`, which contains the cows' phenotype information. Plot the position of all cows in parity 2 between 11:00 and 11:59.

```{r}
# Write your code here
```

\


```         
Note: Once you have finished the exercise, save your changes. Remember not to 'pull' once you have changed the files, or they will overwrite the original repository contents. To avoid this, copy the file out of the directory.
Any questions will be answered on the first day of the course, after we have presented the data that we will be using during the week. There are many possible solutions to this exercise; we will upload one of them to the repository on the first day.
