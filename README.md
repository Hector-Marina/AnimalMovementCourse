Animal movements - from free ranging to restricted indoor environments.

The aim of this course is to learn method approaches to analyse movement data on animals
in natural, semi-natural or indoor environments. The focus will be on using existing R
packages for movement analysis evaluating, how animals are affected by their environments
and what drives their behavioural decisions
