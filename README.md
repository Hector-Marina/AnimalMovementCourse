- `data/raw/animaldata1.csv`: Information about the animals with GPS information
- `data/raw/positions2.csv`: UWB format file
- `data/raw/animaldata2.csv`: Information about the animals with UWB information
- `data/processed/GPSresults1.Rdata`: Processed GPS data
- `data/processed/UWBresults1.Rdata`: Processed UWB data

Output obtained from the diferent analyses:
